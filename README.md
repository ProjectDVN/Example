# Project DVN - Example Application

This is the source code and Windows x64 build for an application example of DVN.

You may use the Windows x64 build directly to make your game.

### Building

To build the application simply run `dub build -a=x86_64` for a 64 bit build in the source folder.

On Windows you can use the *build.bat* batch file to build which automatically builds the application and runs it.
