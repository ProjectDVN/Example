# Project DVN - Example Application

This is the source code and Windows x64 build for an application example of DVN.

You may use the Windows x64 build directly to make your game without compiling and building the application.

This can help up speed the development process. Just note that you will only be able to develop it for x64 on Windows then.

However you can later build the application to appropriate platforms.

### Building

To build the application simply run `dub build -a=x86_64` for a 64 bit build in the source folder.

On Windows you can use the *build.bat* batch file to build which automatically builds the application and runs it.
